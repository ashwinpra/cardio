# CLAUDE.md — Cardio Agent Context

**Cardio** is a real-time multiplayer card game platform. Six games share one monorepo: a Vite+React frontend and a standalone Express+WebSocket backend. No database — all state is in-process server memory.

For deeper context, see [`docs/agent/`](./docs/agent/).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4, Vite |
| Backend | Express 5, `ws` WebSocket library, `tsx` runtime |
| Testing | Vitest |

## NPM Scripts

```
npm run dev        # Vite (:5173) + tsx server (:3001) concurrently
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build
npm run start      # build + run server (production)
npm run kill-ports # kill :3001 and :5173
npm test           # vitest run (single pass)
npm run test:watch # vitest watch
```

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Server Authority
- **All game state mutations happen server-side.** The client never mutates state.
- Client sends action → server validates → mutates → broadcasts sanitized state to all clients.
- `src/games/*/logic.ts` files are shared client+server. They must be isomorphic (no browser/Node APIs).
- Server imports them via relative `.js` paths: `../../src/games/literature/logic.js` (ESM convention, not a bug).

### WebSocket Protocol
All messages are JSON. See [`docs/agent/architecture.md`](./docs/agent/architecture.md) for the full message table.

**Client → Server:** `CREATE_SESSION`, `JOIN_SESSION`, `JOIN_LOBBY`, `START_GAME`, `ASK_CARD`, `CLAIM_BOOK`, `COUP_ACTION`, `SECRET_HITLER_ACTION`, `GAME_ACTION`  
**Server → Client:** `SESSION_CREATED`, `SESSION_JOINED`, `STATE_UPDATE`, `ERROR`

### Session Lifecycle
1. `CREATE_SESSION {gameType}` → server creates session, responds with 4-char hex `sessionId`.
2. Others `JOIN_SESSION {sessionId}` → server adds them to session.
3. All players send `JOIN_LOBBY {player}` → state broadcast.
4. Host (first player) sends `START_GAME` → game handler deals/initializes.
5. On disconnect, server marks player `isConnected: false` and schedules cleanup (2 min if no clients remain).

### Adding a New Game
See [`docs/agent/architecture.md#adding-a-game`](./docs/agent/architecture.md#adding-a-game) for the checklist.

### State Sanitization
`sanitizeStateForPlayer()` in `server/index.ts` strips private information before broadcast (hands, roles, etc.). Each game has its own sanitization branch. When adding game-specific private state, add a branch there.

### No Turn Enforcement by Default
The server does NOT globally enforce turn order — each game handler is responsible. Literature enforces it. Some newer handlers may not.

## Game Modules (quick reference)

| Game | Status | Players | Key mechanic |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Literature | ✅ Fully implemented + tested | 6 or 8 | Team-based half-suit claiming |
| Coup | ✅ Fully implemented | 2–6 | Bluffing, challenges, blocking |
| Secret Hitler | ✅ Fully implemented | 5–10 | Hidden roles, legislative rounds |
| Hanabi | ⚠️ Partial (logic stubs) | 2–5 | Cooperative, hidden-hand hints |
| Love Letter | ⚠️ Partial (logic stubs) | 2–4 | Single-card elimination rounds |
| Spades | ⚠️ Partial (logic stubs) | 4 | Trick-taking, bidding |

Per-game detail in [`docs/agent/games/`](./docs/agent/games/).

## Coding Conventions

- **Immutability**: State mutations must return new objects. Spread operators, not direct mutation.
- **Types**: Game-specific types extend `BaseGameState`. Don't add game-specific fields to `src/shared/types.ts`.
- **Error returns**: Handler functions return `{ state }` on success, `{ error: string }` on failure.
- **Handler signature**: `handleAction(state, data, broadcastState?)` — `broadcastState` is passed for games that need async/deferred broadcasts (Coup, Hanabi, Love Letter, Spades).
- **Tests**: Logic-layer functions are pure and ideal for unit tests. Run `npm test` after any logic change.

## Deployment

- Deployed to **Render** at `https://cardio-5uu3.onrender.com`.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/keep_alive.yml`) pings `/ping` every 14 min to prevent Render cold starts.
- Production: `npm run start` (builds then runs server). Server serves the `dist/` SPA and handles WS upgrades at `/ws`.
